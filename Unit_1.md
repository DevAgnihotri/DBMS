## ✅ **Overview**

### 1. **Data**

**Definition:**  
Data is raw facts and figures that have no meaning on their own.

**Example:**  
`85`, `John`, `Math`, `2025-04-11` — These are just individual pieces of data.

---

### 2. **Information**

**Definition:**  
Information is processed data that has meaning and is useful for decision-making.

**Example:**  
`John scored 85 marks in the Math exam on 2025-04-11.` — This gives meaningful insight using raw data.

---

### 3. **Database**

**Definition:**  
A database is an organized collection of related information stored electronically for easy access and management.

**Example:**  
A table storing students' names, roll numbers, marks, and subjects is a database.

| Roll No | Name | Subject | Marks |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 101     | John | Math    | 85    |
| 102     | Asha | Science | 90    |

---

### 4. **DBMS (Database Management System)**

**Definition:**  
A DBMS is software that helps to create, manage, and use databases efficiently.

**Example:**  
MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, and PostgreSQL are examples of DBMS software.

---

### ✦ Relationship Paragraph:

Data is the basic building block, which when processed becomes information. A **database** stores this data in an organized way, making it easy to manage. A **DBMS** is the software that allows users to interact with the database—such as inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving data. Together, they help in storing and processing data to get meaningful information for various applications, like managing student records, banking systems, and more.

### 📂 What is a File Processing System (FPS)?

A **File Processing System** is a way of storing and managing data using **separate files** for each task or program. Each file is managed by a different program, and there is **no central control** over the data.

> 🔸 **Example**: In a college, there may be different files for student data, fee records, exam results, and library data. Each department manages its own file.

---

### 🗄️ What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?

A **Database Management System** is software that stores and manages all the data in **a single system**. It provides tools to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data, along with **security, consistency, and easy access**.

> 🔸 **Example**: In a DBMS, all student details (name, roll no, fees, results) are stored in a single database, and multiple users can access it based on permission.

---

## 📁 **File System** vs 💾 **Database System (DBMS)**

| **File System**                                        | **Database System (DBMS)**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stores data in separate files manually.                | Stores data in a structured, organized way.                  |
| Data redundancy is **high** (duplicate data).          | Data redundancy is **low** due to normalization.             |
| Data consistency is **difficult** to maintain.         | Ensures **better consistency** of data.                      |
| No built-in security features.                         | Offers **built-in security and access control**.             |
| **Difficult** to search, update, or manage large data. | **Easy** to search, update, and manage large data.           |
| No support for multi-user access or concurrent use.    | **Supports** multiple users and concurrent access.           |
| No backup and recovery system.                         | **Automatic** backup and recovery features available.        |
| Data relationships are **hard to manage**.             | **Efficiently manages** relationships using keys and tables. |

### Why Use DBMS Instead of FPS?\*\*

- File systems are **old and outdated**, with many issues like **repetition, inconsistency, low security**, and more.
- DBMS solves all these problems using **smart tools and techniques**.
- That’s why most modern systems like banks, schools, hospitals use **DBMS** instead of file systems.

## 📘 **Database System Concept and Architecture**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

A **Database System** is a combination of a **database** (organized collection of data) and a **DBMS** (software to manage it). It helps users store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently without needing to know the internal details of how the data is stored.

## 🔹 **Architecture:**

## ✅ **Why is Database Architecture Important?**

- Helps in **understanding the flow of data** from users to storage.
- Allows **multiple users** to work with the database at the same time safely.
- **Separates concerns**, so users don’t have to deal with how data is physically stored.
- Ensures **data security, performance, and maintainability**.

---

## 🧱 **Types of Database Architecture**

There are three main types of architecture:

### 1. **1-Tier Architecture (Single Tier)**

- Everything happens on a single device (user, application, and database are on the same machine).
- Best for **personal or small-scale applications**.

**Example:**  
MS Access on a personal computer.

**Features:**

- Simple and easy to use.
- No network involved.
- Not suitable for multiple users.

---

### 2. **2-Tier Architecture (Client-Server)**

- Divides the system into **two layers**:
  - **Client:** Where users interact (frontend).
  - **Server:** Where database is stored and managed (backend).
- The application sends requests to the database server and gets responses.

**Example:**  
Banking software where the bank clerk enters customer data on a client system, and it’s saved on a central server.

**Features:**

- Better performance than 1-tier.
- Supports multiple users.
- Security and data integrity handled by the server.

---

### 3. **3-Tier Architecture (Most Common in Real Applications)**

This is the most widely used architecture. It has **three layers**:

1. **Presentation Layer (External Level)**

   - This is the user interface.
   - Users interact through web apps, mobile apps, or desktop apps.

2. **Application Layer (Middle Layer / Business Logic)**

   - This contains the logic for processing user requests.
   - It validates data, performs calculations, and connects the UI with the database.

3. **Data Layer (Internal Level)**
   - This is the actual database that stores data.
   - The DBMS manages data storage, queries, security, and backups here.

**Example:**  
Online shopping app:

- You (user) browse products (presentation layer),
- Add items to cart (application layer),
- And the app stores orders in the database (data layer).

---

## 🧠 **Three-Level Architecture (As per DBMS Concept)**

Apart from 1-tier, 2-tier, and 3-tier models, DBMS also follows a special **Three-Level Architecture** designed by ANSI/SPARC. It separates data into three views:

### 1. **External Level (View Level):**

**What it is:**  
This is the topmost level where users see only the data they need, in a way that makes sense to them.

**Key Points:**

- Shows a customized view of the database for each user or group.
- Hides unnecessary details that users don’t need to see.

**Example:**  
A student sees their own marks, while a teacher sees marks for all students in their class.

---

### 2. **Conceptual Level (Logical Level):**

**What it is:**  
This is the middle level that shows the overall design of the database, including what data is stored and how it’s connected.

**Key Points:**

- Focuses on the logical structure of the database (tables, relationships, rules).
- Ensures all user views are consistent and accurate.

**Example:**  
A database with tables like `Students`, `Courses`, and `Enrollments`, showing how they are linked.

---

### 3. **Internal Level (Physical Level):**

**What it is:**  
This is the bottom level that deals with how data is actually stored on the computer.

**Key Points:**

- Handles storage details like file formats, indexing, and data compression.
- Optimizes how data is saved and retrieved.

**Example:**  
Data stored in files with indexes to make searching faster.

---

## 🎯 **Why Use Three-Level Architecture?**

- **Data Independence:** Changes in storage or views don’t affect other levels.
- **Security:** Users can only access the data relevant to them.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to modify one level without disturbing others.

---

## 🔄 **Summary Table**

| **Level**        | **What it Represents**               | **Who Uses It**                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| External Level   | User-specific views of data          | End Users                      |
| Conceptual Level | Logical design of the whole database | Database Designers             |
| Internal Level   | Physical storage details             | Database Administrators (DBAs) |

---

# 📗 **Data Model, Schema, and Instances**

## 📘 **What is a Data Model?**

A **Data Model** is a **way to describe how data is stored, organized, and connected** inside a database. It acts like a **map or design plan** for the database system. Just like a building needs a blueprint before construction, a database needs a data model before development.

---

### 🔹 **Why is a Data Model Important?**

- It helps **design the structure** of the database.
- Makes it easy to **understand the relationships** between different types of data.
- Helps the **DBMS know how to store and retrieve** data efficiently.
- Ensures **data consistency, clarity, and integrity**.

---

## ✅ **Main Features of a Data Model**

- **Structure of data** (e.g., tables, objects, nodes).
- **Data types** (like text, numbers, date, etc.).
- **Relationships** between data (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).
- **Constraints** (like primary key, unique, not null, etc.).

---

## 🔄 **Types of Data Models (Simple + Detailed)**

### 1. **Hierarchical Data Model**

- Organizes data in a **tree-like structure**.
- One parent can have many children, but each child has only one parent.
- Best for **one-to-many** relationships.

**Example:**  
A company database where:

- One department has many employees.
- Each employee belongs to only one department.

```
Department
 ├── Employee1
 ├── Employee2
 └── Employee3
```

---

### 2. **Network Data Model**

- More flexible than hierarchical.
- A child can have **multiple parents** (many-to-many relationships).
- Uses **graph structure** with nodes and connections.

**Example:**  
A project management system where:

- Employees can work on **multiple projects**.
- A project can have **many employees**.

---

### 3. **Relational Data Model** (Most popular)

- Data is stored in **tables (called relations)**.
- Each table has **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.
- Tables can be connected using **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key).

**Example:**  
Student Table:
| ID | Name | Class |
|----|-------|-------|
| 1 | Riya | 10 |
| 2 | Amit | 11 |

Marks Table:
| StudentID | Subject | Marks |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Math | 90 |
| 2 | Science | 85 |

---

### 4. **Object-Oriented Data Model**

- Combines the features of **object-oriented programming** and databases.
- Data is stored as **objects**, just like in programming (with properties and methods).

**Example:**  
A “Car” object can have:

- Attributes like: color, model, speed.
- Methods like: start(), stop().

Useful in applications where both **data and behavior** need to be stored together.

---

### 🔹 **2. Schema**

**Definition:**  
A **schema** is the **overall structure/design** of the database — like a blueprint.

**Example:**  
A student database schema might include tables like:

- Student (ID, Name, Class)
- Marks (StudentID, Subject, Score)

**Types of Schema:**

- **Physical Schema** – How data is stored physically.
- **Logical Schema** – The logical design (tables, relations, etc.).
- **View Schema** – The part of the database shown to users.

---

### 🔹 **3. Instances**

**Definition:**  
An **instance** is the **actual data** stored in the database at a particular moment.

**Example:**  
If a table `Student` has 3 rows today, that is the current instance. If you add or delete rows, the instance changes.

---

### ✨ In Summary:

## A **database system** allows data to be stored and accessed efficiently using a structured **architecture**. This structure includes different levels of views for users and administrators. Data is organized using a **data model**, designed by a **schema**, and filled with real-time **instances** (data values). All of these elements work together to keep the system flexible, efficient, and user-friendly.

## 📘 **Data Definition Language (DDL)**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

**Data Definition Language (DDL)** is a part of SQL that is used to **define and manage the structure** of database objects like tables, schemas, indexes, and views.

### 🔹 **Key Points:**

- It is used to **create, alter, and delete** structures in the database.
- It doesn’t deal with the actual data — only the **structure**.

### 🔧 **Common DDL Commands:**

| Command    | Use                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE`   | To create a new table or database.                   |
| `ALTER`    | To modify an existing table (add/remove columns).    |
| `DROP`     | To delete a table or database.                       |
| `TRUNCATE` | To delete all data from a table (structure remains). |

### 🧠 **Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
   ID INT,
   Name VARCHAR(50),
   Class INT
);
```

---

## 📗 **2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** is used to **insert, update, delete, and retrieve** data in the database.

### 🔹 **Key Points:**

- It works on the **data stored inside tables**.
- It allows users to **manipulate the data without changing the table structure**.

### 🛠️ **Common DML Commands:**

| Command  | Use                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT` | To retrieve data from one or more tables. |
| `INSERT` | To add new records into a table.          |
| `UPDATE` | To change existing data in a table.       |
| `DELETE` | To remove data from a table.              |

### 🧠 **Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (ID, Name, Class) VALUES (1, 'Riya', 10);
```

---

## 🧱 **3. Overall Database Structure**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

The **Overall Database Structure** refers to the way the **database is organized**, including tables, schemas, relationships, and the way data is accessed, stored, and managed.

### 🔹 **Key Elements of Database Structure:**

1. **Tables (Relations):**

   - The basic building blocks of a database.
   - Data is stored in **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.

2. **Schemas:**

   - A **schema** is the **design or layout** of the database.
   - It defines tables, fields, data types, constraints, relationships, etc.

3. **Keys:**

   - **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
   - **Foreign Key:** Links one table to another.

4. **Relationships:**

   - Define how tables are connected.
   - Types:
     - **One-to-One**
     - **One-to-Many**
     - **Many-to-Many**

5. **Indexes:**

   - Help **speed up data retrieval**.
   - Like an index in a book — helps find data faster.

6. **Views:**
   - Virtual tables created by running a query.
   - Shows specific data from one or more tables without changing actual data.

Absolutely, Dev! Let’s properly define everything with clarity, structure, and examples from a **school system**. This will cover all important points related to **Entity**, **Entity Set**, **Logical Entity**, and **Physical Entity** in **DBMS**.

---

## 🧠 **1. Entity **

### ✅ **_Definition:_**

An **entity** is a real-world object that is **distinct**, **uniquely identifiable**, because of it's features.

> In simple words, an entity is **"something" you can store information about** because it exists and is different from others.

### 🏫 Example (School System):

- **Student** is an entity.
- Each student is different (has a unique ID, name, etc.).
- You store details like name, age, roll number, class, etc.

### 🔑 **Key Characteristics:**

- Must be **identifiable** (has a unique ID or property).
- Can be **physical** or **logical**.
- Has **attributes** (properties like name, age, etc.).

---

## 👥 **2. Entity Set **

### ✅ **Definition:**

An **Entity Set** is a **collection of similar entities** in a database.

> It is a **group of entities of the same type** that share the same attributes.

### 🏫 Example:

- All students in a school = **Student Entity Set**
- All teachers = **Teacher Entity Set**
- All classrooms = **Classroom Entity Set**

> Just like "Class 10-A students" is a group, **entity set** is a group of similar entities.

---

## 🧱 **3. Types of Entities**

Entities are mainly classified into two types:

### A. **Physical Entity**

Entities that **exist physically** in the real world and can be touched or seen.

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Student**
- **Teacher**
- **Classroom**
- **Library Books**

These are things you can physically interact with.

---

### B. **Logical Entity**

Entities that **exist logically**, meaning they are concepts or events, not physical objects.

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Course**
- **Attendance Record**
- **Exam Result**
- **Fees Receipt**

You can’t "touch" an attendance record, but it’s real in the database. It's **logically stored and used**.

---

## 🎯 Summary Points

| Concept             | Description                                         | Example (School System)     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Entity**          | A distinguishable object about which data is stored | Student, Teacher, Exam      |
| **Entity Set**      | Collection of similar type of entities              | All students = Student set  |
| **Physical Entity** | Entity with real-world physical existence           | Student, Teacher, Classroom |
| **Logical Entity**  | Entity with logical existence, not physical         | Result, Attendance, Course  |

---

## 🏷️ **Attributes in DBMS**

### ✅ **Definition:**

An **attribute** is a **property or characteristic** of an entity that provides more information about it. Attributes define the **details** or **features** of an entity.

> In simple terms, attributes are the **columns** in a table that describe the **properties** of the rows (entities).

---

### 🏫 **Example (School System):**

For the entity **Student**, the attributes could be:

- **Name** (e.g., John Doe)
- **Roll Number** (e.g., 101)
- **Class** (e.g., 10)
- **Date of Birth** (e.g., 2005-08-15)

---

## 🔄 **Types of Attributes**

Attributes can be classified into the following types:

### 1. **Simple vs Composite Attributes**

#### A. **Simple Attribute**

- A **simple attribute** cannot be divided further into smaller parts.
- It contains a **single value** that represents a property of the entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Roll Number` is a simple attribute.
  - `Class` is a simple attribute.

#### B. **Composite Attribute**

- A **composite attribute** can be divided into smaller sub-parts, each representing a more detailed property.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Full Name` can be divided into:
    - `First Name` (e.g., John)
    - `Last Name` (e.g., Doe)
  - `Address` can be divided into:
    - `Street` (e.g., 123 Main St)
    - `City` (e.g., New York)
    - `Zip Code` (e.g., 10001)

---

### 2. **Single-Valued vs Multi-Valued Attributes**

#### A. **Single-Valued Attribute**

- A **single-valued attribute** holds **only one value** for a particular entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Roll Number` is single-valued (e.g., 101).
  - `Date of Birth` is single-valued (e.g., 2005-08-15).

#### B. **Multi-Valued Attribute**

- A **multi-valued attribute** can hold **multiple values** for a particular entity.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Phone Numbers` can have multiple values (e.g., 123-456-7890, 987-654-3210).
  - `Subjects` can have multiple values (e.g., Math, Science, English).

---

### 3. **Stored vs Derived Attributes**

#### A. **Stored Attribute**

- A **stored attribute** is the one that is **physically stored** in the database.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Date of Birth` is a stored attribute (e.g., 2005-08-15).

#### B. **Derived Attribute**

- A **derived attribute** is **calculated** from other attributes and is **not stored** in the database.

**Example:**

- For a **Student**:
  - `Age` can be derived from the `Date of Birth` (e.g., Current Year - Birth Year).
  - `Total Marks` can be derived by summing up marks from all subjects.

---

## 🧱 **Summary Table**

| **Type**                    | **Definition**                         | **Example (School System)**                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Attribute**        | Cannot be divided further.             | Roll Number, Class                                             |
| **Composite Attribute**     | Can be divided into smaller sub-parts. | Full Name (First Name, Last Name), Address (Street, City, Zip) |
| **Single-Valued Attribute** | Holds only one value for an entity.    | Roll Number, Date of Birth                                     |
| **Multi-Valued Attribute**  | Holds multiple values for an entity.   | Phone Numbers, Subjects                                        |
| **Stored Attribute**        | Physically stored in the database.     | Date of Birth                                                  |
| **Derived Attribute**       | Calculated from other attributes.      | Age (calculated from Date of Birth), Total Marks               |
